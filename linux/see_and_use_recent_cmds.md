# See and use recent commands

To see recent commands, use `history`. Follow with `!n` (where n is the command number) to execute again. There are also many abbreviations you can use, the most useful probably being `!$` for last argument and `!!` for last command (see "HISTORY EXPANSION" in the man page). However, these are often easily replaced with `ctrl-r` and `alt-.`.
