# Check if port is in use

The `lsof` command is used to *list open files*. This includes listing network connections. This means I can check if a particular port is in use and what process is using that port. For instance, I can check if my rails application is currently running on port 3000.

```
$ lsof -i TCP:3000
COMMAND   PID       USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
ruby    13821 jbranchaud   12u  IPv6 0xdf2e9fd346cc12b5      0t0  TCP localhost:hbci (LISTEN)
ruby    13821 jbranchaud   13u  IPv4 0xdf2e9fd33ca74d65      0t0  TCP localhost:hbci (LISTEN)
```

I can see that a ruby process (my rails app) is using port 3000. The PID and a number of other details are included.

See more details with `man lsof`.
