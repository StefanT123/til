# String manipulation on the command line

`ctrl-w` to delete the last word,
`ctrl-u` to delete the content from current cursor back to the start of the line
`alt-b` to move back by a word
`alt-f` to move forward a by word
`ctrl-a` to move cursor to beginning of line
`ctrl-e` to move cursor to end of line
`ctrl-k` to kill to the end of the line
`ctrl-l` to clear the screen

See man readline for all the default keybindings in Bash. There are a lot. For example `alt-.` cycles through previous arguments, and `alt-*` expands a glob.
